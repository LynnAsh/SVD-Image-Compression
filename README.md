# SVD Image Compression

A simple program that takes advantage of SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to compress images
 - Works in greyscale **and** color!

### To-do
 - Hopefully fix the color channels distorting after compression
 - Soon going to add a way to plot points and compare k to the Compression Ratio and MSE/PSNR
 - Maybe comb through and optimize where need be, I dont think its the most efficient right now but eh
